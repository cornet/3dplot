NAME
       3dplot - Interactive and Non-Interactive Plotting program

SYNOPSIS
       3dplot [<options>] [-m] <file>

DESCRIPTION
       3dplot  is  a  portable  graphing  program  using  OpenGL to render the
       graphs.  Either a data file is given or a file  containing  a  list  of
       frames to render.

       Primarilly  a  non-interactive program although if called without -o or
       -O then 3dplot runs in interactive mode allowing real time control over
       some of the parameters.

       Please  see  the  FILE_SPECS  file  for details on the structure of the
       datafiles.

       -v     Enable debug messages.

       -V     Ouput version and quit.

       -C <red>,<green>,<blue>
              Specify the colour used to render the graph.  Values  should  be
              between 0 and 255.

       -s <width>,<height>
              Set size of window/render, in pixels.

       -g <red1>,<blue1>,<green1>,<red2>,<blue2>,<green2>
              Use     gradient,     height     map,     fill    from    colour
              <red1>,<blue1>,<green1> to colour <red2>,<blue2>,<green2>.  Val-
              ues should be between 0 and 255.

       -f     Use  flat  shading,  this  might improve rendering speed on slow
              machines.

       -w     Render wireframe model.

       -o <file>
              Ouput to <file>. Extension of file  determines  filetype.   Many
              filetypes supported, see ImageMagick library for full list.

       -O <basedir>
              Used  with  -m  Render  movie frames in <basedir>.  Without this
              3dplot will render to screen as fast as possible.

       -m <framelist>
              Render  all  datafiles  listed  in  <framelist>  as  an   anima-
              tion/movie.

       -l <x>,<y>,<z>
              Place a light at position <x>,<y>,<z> pointing towards origin.

       -a <x1>,<x2>,<y1>,<y2>,<z1>,<z2>
              Define axis lengths. X-axis from <x1> to <x2> etc...

       -t <x>,<y>,<z>,<x0>,<y0>,<z0>,<xup>,<yup>,<zup>
              Place  camera  at  <x>,<y>,<z>.  Point  towards  <x0>,<y0>,<z0>.
              <xup>,<yup>,<zup> defines the vector orientation of the  camera.

CONTROLS
       Arrow keys move camera around the graph.


EXAMPLES
       To render the movie, in the <basedir> after running 3dplot.

       $ ffmpeg -i frame%d.png output.mpg

       will stream the frames together into a movie.
