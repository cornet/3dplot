Roadmap
The 3dplot program is far from complete. Many hundreds of features could be thought up and added over time.
3dplot differs from previous implementations in many ways. Not only is it portable, it is highly maintainable.
The reference manual provides all the information required to add to the project and it is hoped that people will do so.
It is hoped that 3dplot will never be complete, it was written to hopefully be the basis for a excellent mathematical tool
along the lines of Gnuplot. Work on Gnuplot is still continuing many years after it was first created and easily offers far more control
plotting than commercial plotting that support plotting such as Excel. The philosophy of one tool for one job is often not adopted,
yes the initial learning process might be more lengthy, but in the long run it is usually the best.

What follows is a list of proposed developments for 3dplot:
* Full animation support using the FFMPEG or XviD libraries to output to video stream
* Full control over lights and materials including a database of materials that can be used
* Portability to Windows tested and confirmed. (Should just require the library locations defining)
* Config file support finished. All variables should be able to be declared in config file
* Support more native file output formats. At present only TGA, PPM and BMP are supported. The rest are handled by the ImageMagick libraries
* Dynamic reading of non-standard data files. You define the format at runtime rather than having to add direct support
